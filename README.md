# 🧠 AI-Powered Chess Coach (Stockfish + ML)

## 🚀 What it does
This project combines **Stockfish**, a powerful open-source chess engine, with **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze and provide insights into chess moves and strategies.  

It helps chess players by:
- Suggesting the best moves using **Stockfish**.
- Providing additional insights using an **ML model trained on chess data**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Stockfish API**
- **TensorFlow**
- **python-chess** (for board representation)

## 📥 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Powered-Chess-Coach.git
cd AI-Powered-Chess-Coach
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Download and Set Up Stockfish
1. Download **Stockfish** from the official site: [Stockfish Download](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)
2. Extract the executable and place it inside the `stockfish/` directory.
3. Update the path in `main.py`:
   ```python
   stockfish = Stockfish(path="stockfish/stockfish_14.1_win_x64_bmi2.exe")
   ```

---

## ▶️ Usage
### Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

It will output:
- **Stockfish's suggested best move**
- **ML model's analysis of the position**
